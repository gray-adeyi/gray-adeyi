Hi there! You're looking in the right place if its the
account of Gbenga Adeyi you're looking for.

## Who am I?
I'm a student of Electrical engineering who got hooked to
the world of programming. The usual story...wanted to be
an hacker(no luck on that and I learnt my first real lesson
that if you wanted to be a true hacker, you had to understand
the inner workings of the computer system). Started with 
Java but it was too hard for my potato brain to absorb at the timeðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
So I tried python and she became my first love. I'm by no means
an expert on the subject but my curiosity and willingness to 
learn has kept me and still will to move further past my limitations.
(No CS Degree & No Bootcamps. Just Google,Youtube,Ebooks & Stackoverflow ðŸ˜Ž)
Over the years I've been exposed to other technologies. I'll tell my
story better if we happen to connect and I'd love to hear yours.
